## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used in Back-End

The following libraries and technologies were utilized in the project:

#### Python Libraries
1. **pandas**
   - Used for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **numpy**
   - Utilized for numerical computations and array operations.
3. **matplotlib**
   - For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
4. **seaborn**
   - Built on top of matplotlib for statistical data visualization.

#### Machine Learning & Data Preprocessing
5. **sklearn (scikit-learn)**
   - Modules used:
     - `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`: For evaluating classification models.
     - `compute_class_weight`: To handle imbalanced datasets.
     - `StandardScaler`: For standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

#### Deep Learning Framework
6. **Keras** (TensorFlow backend)
   - Modules and functionalities:
     - `Model`: For building and training deep learning models.
     - Layers:
       - `Dense`: Fully connected layers.
       - `Convolution1D`: For 1D convolutional layers.
       - `MaxPool1D`: For pooling operations in 1D data.
       - `Flatten`: To flatten the input.
       - `Input`: For input specification.
       - `BatchNormalization`: To normalize the activations.
       - `Dropout`: For regularization to prevent overfitting.
     - Callbacks:
       - `EarlyStopping`: To stop training when performance stops improving.
       - `ModelCheckpoint`: To save the model with the best performance.
       - `ReduceLROnPlateau`: To reduce learning rate when the metric has stopped improving.
     - `to_categorical`: For one-hot encoding of labels.

7. **Flask**
   - A micro web framework used to create the server for handling requests and responses.
   - Provides endpoints for model inference and data handling.

8. **Flask-CORS**
   - Used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the Flask application, allowing it to interact with front-end applications hosted on different domains.

9. **Keras**
    - Utilized for loading pre-trained models for deep learning tasks.

10. **pandas**
    - Provides functionalities for data manipulation and analysis.

11. **numpy**
    - Supports numerical computations and array operations.

12. **scikit-learn**
    - Modules used:
      - `StandardScaler`: For standardizing numerical features to improve model performance.

13. **os**
    - Used for interacting with the operating system for file handling and path manipulations.


### Summary
These technologies are collectively used to:
- These libraries collectively support tasks like data processing, visualization, model evaluation, and building advanced deep learning models.
- Build and deploy a Flask-based API for handling machine learning model predictions.
- Preprocess input data using pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
- Load pre-trained models using Keras and joblib.
- Ensure compatibility with front-end applications using Flask-CORS.
- Use of open-source dataset for training and evaluation of the CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model.
